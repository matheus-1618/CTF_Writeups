First, lets go the challenge directory:
# cd ../../challenge 
Run the /babysuid_level2, for obtain the
suid level, and for get some hints for the problem:
# ./babysuid_level2
    Welcome to ./babysuid_level2!

    This challenge is part of a series of programs that
    exposes you to very simple programs that let you directly read the flag.

    I just set the SUID bit on /usr/bin/more.
    Try to use it to read the flag!

    IMPORTANT: make sure to run me (./babysuid_level2) every time that you restart
    this challenge container to make sure that I set the SUID bit on /usr/bin/more!

    After this, just go backwards and use cat on flag file

# cd ..
# more flag
